## Part-2: SIFT Features and Descriptors

My code is reference from **[Demo Software: SIFT Keypoint Detector](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/)**. What's more , I also used `sift.m` and `siftWin32.exe` as core part of SIFT Features and Descriptors.  **Please use Demo carefully, the author has the patent of Demo Software.**
